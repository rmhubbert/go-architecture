# Layered

The Layered Architecture is a design pattern that organizes an application into a series of layers, each with a specific responsibility. This approach separates concerns and defines clear boundaries between different aspects of the application.

- **Presentation Layer**: Manages user interface, user interactions, and API calls. Handles inputs, returns or displays outputs, and ensures communication with users.
- **Application/Service Layer**: Contains business logic and coordinates between the Presentation and Data layers. Defines the application's rules and processes.
- **Data Access Layer**: Handles interactions with databases, file systems, or external services. Encapsulates data storage and retrieval logic.

## Workflow in a Layered Architecture

- **Request Flow**: A request from the user starts at the Presentation Layer, passes through the Application Layer, and reaches the Data Access Layer to interact with the database.
- **Response Flow**: The result flows back from the Data Access Layer to the Application Layer and finally to the Presentation Layer for display.

## Advantages of a Layered Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a distinct role, simplifying development and maintenance.
- **Scalability**: Enables scaling specific layers independently (e.g., scaling the Presentation Layer for more users).
- **Testability**: Testing is easier because layers can be tested independently.
- **Reusability**: Layers like the Data Access Layer can be reused across different projects or modules.
- **Flexibility**: Changes in one layer (e.g., updating the UI) usually donâ€™t affect other layers.
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation helps developers quickly identify where changes need to be made.

## Disadvantages of Layered Architecture

- **Performance Overhead**: Data must pass through multiple layers, potentially slowing response times.
- **Rigid Structure**: Adhering to strict boundaries can make it challenging to handle cross-cutting concerns like logging or caching.
- **Complexity for Simple Applications**: The architecture may be overkill for small or straightforward systems.
- **Dependency Management**: Layers can become tightly coupled if dependencies are not carefully managed, defeating the purpose of separation.
- **Parallel Development Challenges**: Teams working on different layers need robust communication to avoid integration issues.

## Use Cases

- Suitable for enterprise applications with well-defined workflows and multiple developers.
- Ideal for scenarios where reusability, testability, and maintainability are more important than raw performance.

Layered Architecture is a tried-and-true design pattern, balancing modularity and clarity with a trade-off in complexity and potential performance hits.
