### Simple Architecture

It doesn't get much simpler than this. One package, and a minimal amount of files. This simple architecture is perfect for quick prototyping and will normally be the first architecture you try for a micro service.

To be honest, you'll rarely need anything more complex than this if you can keep your service scope small. Keeping things small and simple is certainly idiomatic for a Go app, at least!
