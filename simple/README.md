# Simple

It doesn't get much simpler than this. One package, and a minimal amount of files. This simple architecture is perfect for quick prototyping and will normally be the first architecture you try for a micro service. To be honest, you'll rarely need anything more complex than this if you can keep your service scope small. Keeping things small and simple is certainly idiomatic for a Go app, at least!

Some key characteristics of a simple, single directory architecture include -

- **Flat Structure**: Files are placed in one directory, possibly with minimal categorization (e.g., separating scripts, assets, or configuration files).
- **Minimal Organization**: There is little to no formal separation of concerns like UI, business logic, and data management.
- **Simplicity**: The focus is on ease of access and quick development, without intricate architectural patterns.

## Advantages of a Simple Architecture

- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement, especially for new developers or small teams.
- **Fast Development**: Ideal for rapid prototyping or small-scale projects where speed is more critical than structure.
- **Ease of Navigation**: All files are in one place, making them easy to locate without navigating through multiple directories.
- **Low Overhead**: No need to design or manage a complex folder structure or adhere to strict patterns.
- **Lightweight**: Well-suited for scripts, utilities, or projects with minimal functionality.

## Disadvantages of a Simple Architecture

- **Scalability Issues**: As the application grows, the lack of structure makes it harder to manage and navigate.
- **Maintenance Challenges**: Identifying and updating specific functionality becomes increasingly difficult as the codebase expands.
- **Tight Coupling**: Components often end up tightly coupled, making testing, debugging, or reusing code challenging.
- **Risk of Code Duplication**: Without separation of concerns, functionality may be duplicated across files.
- **Limited Collaboration**: Multiple developers working on the same directory can lead to conflicts and reduced productivity.
- **Difficult Testing and Reusability**: Lack of modularity can make unit testing and reusing code fragments cumbersome.

## Use Cases

- **Small Scripts**: Suitable for standalone utilities, one-off tasks, or simple command-line tools.
- **Prototyping**: Useful for quickly testing ideas or developing proof-of-concept applications.
- **Learning Projects**: Ideal for beginners learning to code or experimenting with new technologies.

A single-directory software architecture is best for small-scale projects or prototypes where simplicity and speed are priorities. While it offers ease of use and minimal overhead, it lacks scalability and maintainability, making it unsuitable for larger, more complex applications.
