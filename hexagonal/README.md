# Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters

The Hexagonal Architecture, also known as the Ports and Adapters Architecture, is a design pattern aimed at creating flexible, maintainable, and testable applications. It organizes the application into a central core (the domain logic) surrounded by "ports" and "adapters" that handle interactions with the outside world.
Some of the key concepts in hexagonal architecture include -

- **Domain Core**: Encapsulates the business logic, independent of external concerns like databases or user interfaces.
- **Ports**: Define the interfaces through which the core communicates with the outside world. Ports can be thought of as contracts for interaction.
- **Adapters**: Implement the ports to connect the core to external systems, such as user interfaces, databases, APIs, or third-party services.
- **Bidirectional Communication**: The architecture supports both incoming interactions (e.g., user requests) and outgoing interactions (e.g., calling a database or external service).

## Workflow in a Hexagonal Architecture

- **Incoming Requests**: Requests from the external world are routed through an adapter to the corresponding port.
  The port communicates with the core, triggering the appropriate business logic.
- **Outgoing Requests**: When the core needs to interact with external systems, it does so through ports.
  Adapters implement these ports to handle the specifics of the external interaction.

## Advantages of a Hexagonal Architecture

- **Independence**: The business logic is isolated from external systems, making the core independent of frameworks or technologies.
- **Flexibility**: The architecture makes it easy to swap out external systems (e.g., replacing a database) by simply changing the adapter.
- **Testability**: The core can be tested in isolation using mock ports and adapters.
- **Scalability**: The modular design allows for easy addition of new functionalities by creating new ports and adapters.
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the system easier to understand and maintain.
- **Adaptability**: The architecture accommodates changes in external systems or requirements without affecting the core.

## Disadvantages of a Hexagonal Architecture

- **Complexity**: Designing and implementing ports and adapters for every interaction adds development effort and complexity.
- **Overhead**: The abstraction layers can introduce slight performance overhead.
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand and implement the architecture properly to reap its benefits.
- **Overengineering Risk**: For small or simple applications, this architecture may be overkill.
- **Tooling and Framework Limitations**: Some frameworks may not natively support the flexibility required, requiring additional customization.

## Use Cases

- **Domain-driven Design**: Hexagonal architecture aligns well with projects focused on domain-driven design principles.
- **Complex Systems**: Ideal for applications that need to interact with multiple external systems or evolve over time.
- **Test-driven Development**: Works well with TDD by isolating the domain core for testing.

Hexagonal Architecture is a robust approach for building applications that prioritize flexibility, maintainability, and testability. While it may introduce complexity, its emphasis on isolating business logic from external dependencies makes it an excellent choice for medium to large-scale applications where adaptability is critical.
